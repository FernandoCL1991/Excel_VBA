# Excel VBA: Loops, Iterations, If-Else Statements, Conditional Formating

# Analyzing Stocks

Created a VBA Script to analyze the entire data of Stocks accross different time slots, while the script could be used in different CSV files: alphabetical_testing and mutiple_year_stock

The goal was to use tools such as Loops, Iterations, If- Else statements, conditional formating; everything applied to every single Excel Worksheet that contained the stock data.

The final result is a summary table that shows the best performing Stocks across the time analyzed.
