# Excel_VBA

Creating a VBA Script to analyze the entire data of Stocks applicable in any of the two files: alphabetical_testing and mutiple_year_stock

The goal was to use tools such as Loops, Iterations, If- Else statements, conditional formating; everything applied to every single Excel Worksheet that contained the stock data.

The final result is a summary table that shows the best performing Stocks across the time analyzed.
